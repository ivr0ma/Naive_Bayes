It's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness, and where Human Nature should be ingratiating, it's just grating.
'All in all, Reign of Fire will be a good (successful) rental.'
Just how extreme are these ops? I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough.

Mr. Goyer's loose, unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way.
The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections.
Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle.
(Gai) comes closer to any actress I can remember to personifying independence in its purest and, yes, most intimidating form.
It's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'The Loud and the Ludicrous'...the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated.
The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism, but it's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia.
It's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film.
One sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot.
This is a film well worth seeing, talking and singing heads and all.

Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights.
While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills, suspense, and gore for video games, the movie really only succeeds in the third of these.
It's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good.
Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please, and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses, nor their characters, deserve.
It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit. So I just did.
Ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics, delivering a series of abrasive, stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory.
This thing is just garbage.
Though the controversial Korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes, it offers gorgeous imagery, effective performances, and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding.
With the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like Tremors, Eight Legged Freaks is prime escapist fare.
that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
A brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others.
Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples, and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world, offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications.
The Chateau... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters.
A movie with a real anarchic flair.
Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market.
I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation.

It's predictable, but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth.
It's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between Chaplin and Kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking, but humming.
Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics.
While the path may be familiar, first-time director Denzel Washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting.
Mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination.
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay, screeching-metal smashups, and flaccid odd-couple sniping.
What you would end up with if you took Orwell, Bradbury, Kafka, George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender. But that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients.
Its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch.
An enthralling, entertaining feature.
My Wife is an Actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy. In the end, though, it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more.
A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects, hoary dialogue, fluxing accents, and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks.
So young, so smart, such talent, such a wise ***.
Performances all around are tops, with the two leads delivering Oscar-caliber performances.
A sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer.
Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio. As for children, they won't enjoy the movie at all.
Like all abstract art, the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way, and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all.
Unfolds in a low-key, organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow.
We want the funk - and this movie's got it.
The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker.
'...the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop, and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama.'
Not always too whimsical for its own good (but enough to do harm), this strange hybrid of crime thriller, quirky character study, third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs.
As Hugh Grant says repeatedly throughout the movie, 'Lovely! Brilliant!'
Elvira fans could hardly ask for more.
Not only is Undercover Brother as funny, if not more so, than both Austin Powers films, but it's also one of the smarter, savvier spoofs to come along in some time.

Woefully pretentious.
...the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes ``What Time Is It There?'' something the true film buff will enjoy.
Oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition.

White hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures, one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else.
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again, and while that is a cliche, nothing could be more appropriate. It's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one.

The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad.
(A) painfully flat gross-out comedy ...

Those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective.
There are some laughs in this movie, but Williams' anarchy gets tiresome, the satire is weak.

Largely, this is a movie that also does it by the numbers.
Murderous Maids pulls no punches in its depiction of the lives of the Papin sister and the events that led to their notorious rise to infamy...

Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations.
What makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people, in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship, bring to their music.
Both lead performances are Oscar-size. Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie, and Moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver.
This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost.

Parts seem like they were lifted from Terry Gilliam's subconscious, pressed through Kafka's meat grinder and into BuÃ±uel's casings
As David Letterman and The Onion have proven, the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor, but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them.
The Irwins' scenes are fascinating; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts.
The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending.
One of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made.
Isn't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself? And it's a lousy one at that.
One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie, but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations.

Much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever.
If you're hard up for raunchy college humor, this is your ticket right here.
The draw (for ``Big Bad Love'') is a solid performance by Arliss Howard.

plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood.
Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere.
The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming.

Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give ``Scratch'' a second look.
An unholy mess, driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape, it must be labelled 'hip', 'innovative' and 'realistic'.
To those who have not read the book, the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,' but that's not saying much.
Though it goes further than both, anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here, but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary.
It suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation, from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like Hatfield and Hicks.
Offers no new insight on the matter, nor do its characters exactly spring to life.
Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic, extreme-sports adventure, but ends up more of a creaky ``Pretty Woman'' retread, with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought.
A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative, of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking.
Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is, this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done.
Nicolas Cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray, and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career.

A beyond-lame satire, Teddy Bears' Picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor.
This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece, in treading the line between sappy and sanguine, winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand.
Angel presents events partly from the perspective of Aurelie and Christelle, and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale.
This rich, bittersweet Israeli documentary, about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach'ke Burstein and his family, transcends ethnic lines.
Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread.
Using a stock plot, About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater.
The appearance of Treebeard and Gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing, or rolling your eyes. I loved it! Gollum's 'performance' is incredible!
The problem with all of this: It's not really funny.
Those who don't entirely 'get' Godard's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy.
I've never seen (a remake) do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler's new movie rapes, pillages and incinerates Frank Capra's classic...
If I have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story (like, say, Treasure Planet) or so-so animation and an exciting, clever story with a batch of appealing characters, I'll take the latter every time.
If you can stomach the rough content, it's worth checking out for the performances alone.

Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd, but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time.
The film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo, but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking, quietly vulnerable personality of Ms. Ambrose.
Elling, portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by Per Christian Ellefsen, is a truly singular character, one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone.
The lower your expectations, the more you'll enjoy it.
Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners, a fact which, as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs, seems inconceivable.
Notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour, I'm going to recommend SECRETARY, based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal, and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
A strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet.

The biggest problem I have (other than the very sluggish pace) is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress, even though her talent is supposed to be growing.
What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points.

Who, exactly, is fighting whom here? Ah, yes, that would be me: fighting off the urge to doze.
Scotland looks wonderful, the fans are often funny fanatics, the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf.
Director Kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure, and this is a better film than his earlier English-language movie, the overpraised Elizabeth.
The Scorpion King is more fun than Conan the Barbarian.
Low rent from frame one.
A timid, soggy near miss.

Works because we're never sure if Ohlinger's on the level or merely a dying, delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks.

There's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career.

Aggravating and tedious.

The script's judgment and sense of weight is way, way off.

It's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our Hollywood has all but lost.

(A) poorly executed comedy.
First-time director JoÃ£o Pedro Rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on.

(There's) quite a bit of heart, as you would expect from the directors of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.
The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups.
The film gets close to the chimps the same way Goodall did, with a serious minded patience, respect and affection.
The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket (second prize, of course, two free tickets) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie.

A real clunker. A well-made, thoughtful, well-acted clunker, but a clunker nonetheless.
The Sweetest Thing, a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies, may be a mess in a lot of ways. But it does have one saving grace. A lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view.

Writer and director Otar Iosseliani's pleasant tale about a factory worker who escapes for a holiday in Venice reveals how we all need a playful respite from the grind to refresh our souls.
Suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative. Still, as a visual treat, the film is almost unsurpassed.
A weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it, offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern L.A.'s show-biz and media subcultures. But it doesn't leave you with much.
Pure of intention and passably diverting, His Secret Life is light, innocuous and unremarkable.
This mild-mannered farce, directed by one of its writers, John C. Walsh, is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago.

Pumpkin wants to have it both ways.
A cockeyed shot all the way.

A Movie to Forget
Decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies, newsreels and the like. The unexpected thing is that its dying, in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia, is quite beautiful.
It's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter, but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible.
Although Olivier Assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems, at times, padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation ... its three-hour running time plays closer to two.

There are moments of hilarity to be had.
Ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting, Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum.

All in all, Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence.
It won't harm anyone, but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it. After all, it'll probably be in video stores by Christmas, and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies.

Happy Times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it.

... the movie is just a plain old monster.

The film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen.
With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles, where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble, The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas, but it never manages to put them on the same path.
This concoction, so bizarre to the adult mind, is actually a charming triumph where its intended under-12 audience is concerned.
The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama, but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul's perspective.
John McTiernan's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga. It's also stupider.
It's hard to imagine anybody ever being ``in the mood'' to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone, but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started.
The biggest problem with Roger Avary's uproar against the MPAA is that, even in all its director's cut glory, he's made a film that's barely shocking, barely interesting and most of all, barely anything.
Steven Spielberg brings us another masterpiece
It's a smart, funny look at an arcane area of popular culture, and if it isn't entirely persuasive, it does give exposure to some talented performers.
Energetic and boldly provocative.
A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not.
Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans. But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm, this is the opposite of a truly magical movie.
84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare. It's also, clearly, great fun.
An oddity, to be sure, but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion.
Makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun.
Any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners, poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss.

A little weak -- and it isn't that funny.
Disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical ``Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' which also dealt with British children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime.

(Ramsay) visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art, music and metaphor.
How I Killed My Father would be a rarity in Hollywood. It's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects, but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones.
A subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience; The Pianist does not.
To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable.

A certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents.
The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time.

To the civilized mind, a movie like Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement.
We just don't really care too much about this love story. In that setting, their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting.
...a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs. It is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
... with the gifted Pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically, this retooled Machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest, crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself.
The closest thing to the experience of space travel
The low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense, claustrophobic tale of obsessive love.
At times, it actually hurts to watch.

A grim, flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level.
A solid film...but more conscientious than it is truly stirring.

Ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years.
The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure, but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is.
The plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back.
A solidly entertaining little film.
If Hill isn't quite his generation's Don Siegel (or Robert Aldrich), it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair; it's all bluster and clichÃ©.
Quite funny for the type of movie it is...
What could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey.
The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie.
All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto.
It all plays out ... like a high-end John Hughes comedy, a kind of Elder Bueller's Time Out.

A film in a class with Spike Lee's masterful Do The Right Thing.
If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour, I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation.

A bright, inventive, thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy.
A good piece of work more often than not.
With the dog days of August upon us, think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity.
Nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition.
Norton holds the film together.
There's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups.
Stephen Earnhart's homespun documentary Mule Skinner Blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens.
A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd, contrived, overblown, and entirely implausible finale.
It's funny, as the old saying goes, because it's true.

Like the Tuck family themselves, this movie just goes on and on and on and on
An intoxicating experience.

Hits one out of the park for the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' department.
Consistently clever and suspenseful.

A mawkish, implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison.
Boomers and their kids will have a Barrie good time.
A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception, which, while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces, is still very much worth seeing.

As teen movies go, ``Orange County'' is a refreshing change

I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness.
The performances are remarkable.
Jacquot's rendering of Puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera. In his first stab at the form, Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically.
Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo's cool jackets.

Fans of critics' darling band Wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky, always brooding look of I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.
(Barry) gives Assassin a disquieting authority.
A moody, multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery, Solaris is a thought-provoking, haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate.
So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along.
Adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of Orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book.
Both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes.

The engagingly primitive animated special effects contribute to a mood that's sustained through the surprisingly somber conclusion.
Serving Sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs.
The Quiet American isn't a bad film, it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar.

Overly long and worshipful bio-doc.
A crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing.
The film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet.
There's no clear picture of who killed Bob Crane. But here's a glimpse at his life.

An edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era.
Emerges as something rare, an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one.

The film delivers not just the full assault of Reno's immense wit and insight, but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days.
This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy.
Even if you don't understand what on earth is going on, this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion, if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why.
A hypnotic portrait of this sad, compulsive life.
It's played in the most straight-faced fashion, with little humor to lighten things up. The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence.
It's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in French (well, mostly) with English subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that.
Unlike most surf movies, Blue Crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave. By the end you can't help but feel 'stoked.'

Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia's moody, bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance.
Woven together handsomely, recalling sixties' rockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Don't Look Back.
the Venezuelans say things like ``si, pretty much'' and ``por favor, go home'' when talking to Americans. That's muy loco, but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of ``Dragonfly.''
The film is like sitting in a downtown cafÃ©, overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing, and desperately wishing you could change tables.
Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets. Some of the characters die and others don't, and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson, and, really, nobody in the viewing audience cares.
If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth, there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows.
A deftly entertaining film, smartly played and smartly directed.
Never comes together as a coherent whole.
As dumb and cheesy as they may be, the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy, supposed family-friendly comedy.
In XXX, Diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners, and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep.
Meant to reduce Blake's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator Todd McFarlane's superhero dystopia.
Familiar but utterly delightful.
Rarely do films come along that are as intelligent, exuberant, and moving as Monsoon Wedding.
Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder, however, Kilmer seems to be posing, rather than acting. And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea.
A graceful, contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined.
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture. We can tell what it is supposed to be, but can't really call it a work of art.
Even if it ultimately disappoints, the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat.
Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due.
... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman.
This is a movie full of grace and, ultimately, hope.
A soggy, shapeless mess...just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie.
A little better than Sorcerer's Stone.

I have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration, but I've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than I want to believe.
Thoroughly awful.
The fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that Broomfield's interviewees, or even himself, will not be for much longer.
If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise, it would have been better off dead.
Brown's saga, like many before his, makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie.
It won't hold up over the long haul, but in the moment, Finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a Saturday matinee.
Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness. But what is missing from it all is a moral. What is the filmmakers' point? Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery?
The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge. These are names to remember, in order to avoid them in the future.
This surreal Gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of Ecclesiastes. A rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers.
The movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength.
Altogether, this is successful as a film, while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece.
It's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom, and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive.
For a long time the film succeeds with its dark, delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them.
Manages to delight without much of a story.
Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is.
You won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these Veggies.
'Enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that Hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'We Were Soldiers.'

This is nothing but familiar territory.
A sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about.
Who are 'they'? Well, they're 'they'. They're the unnamed, easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid. They exist for hushed lines like ``They're back!'', ``They're out there!'' and ``They're coming!''
Not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable, but also a perfectly rendered period piece.
A whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking Christian-themed fun.
If this disposable tissue has one wild card, it's John Turturro, who's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish.
Some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but I think Payne is after something darker.
Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed, haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining.
If swimfan does catch on, it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh.
(Russell) makes good B movies (The Mask, The Blob), and The Scorpion King more than ably meets those standards.

Tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to Liyan's backyard.
The Pianist (is) a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we, today, can prevent its tragic waste of life. Here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life, his dignity and his music.

The story has its redundancies, and the young actors, not very experienced, are sometimes inexpressive.

If you open yourself up to Mr. Reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set ... it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change.
Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination.
Collapses under its own meager weight.
Terrific as Nadia, a Russian mail-order bride who comes to America speaking not a word of English, it's Kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers.
Brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness.
It's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness, while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene.
Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work.

Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible.
Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be.
Strip it of all its excess debris, and you'd have a 90-minute, four-star movie. As it is, it's too long and unfocused.
Fails to bring as much to the table.
Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters.
Jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips.
Peppering this urban study with references to Norwegian folktales, Villeneuve creates in Maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical.

Where This was lazy but enjoyable, a formula comedy redeemed by its stars, That is even lazier and far less enjoyable.
Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B-scene: neither as funny nor as clever, though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes.

Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash.

It's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell.
'Rare Birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience.

Melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting, and always a beauty to behold.
An overstylized, purÃ©ed mÃ©lange of sex, psychology, drugs and philosophy. Sometimes entertaining, sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery.
A bonanza of wacky sight gags, outlandish color schemes, and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract Frank Tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career.
This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground.

The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the (teen comedy) genre a bad name.

It's just plain boring.
Be patient with the lovely Hush! and your reward will be a thoughtful, emotional movie experience.
Superior genre storytelling, which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line.
Filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels. So, too, is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's New Delhi.
Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in, 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters.
Too loud, too long and too frantic by half, Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over, tunnel under or barrel through.
The film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political Blair Witch, a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen.

Who needs love like this?

The movie does its best to work us over, with second helpings of love, romance, tragedy, false dawns, real dawns, comic relief, two separate crises during marriage ceremonies, and the lush scenery of the Cotswolds.
If it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son, more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions.
The tone errs on the shrill side, tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty, grace and a closet full of skeletons.
Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic.

The script, the gags, the characters are all direct-to-video stuff, and that's where this film should have remained.
Phoned-in business as usual.

The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character.

Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film? I don't think so. Nothing wrong with performances here, but the whiney characters bugged me.
Moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought. Better still, he does all of this, and more, while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of Jonathan Swift.

The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career.
For those in search of something different, Wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale.

The genius of the work speaks volumes, offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates.
The continued good chemistry between Carmen and Juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going, with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained.

A devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism.
A clever blend of fact and fiction.

And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawrence's over-indulgent tirade, then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest. If you are willing to do this, then you so crazy!

Often silly â and gross â but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films.

Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot, no real conflict, no real point.

It's a rare window on an artistic collaboration.
Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience.

The only way to tolerate this insipid, brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers.
An alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary.
If the plot seems a bit on the skinny side, that's because Panic Room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in...and making you sweat.
Hilarious, touching and wonderfully dyspeptic.

A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of.

Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack.
The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance.

Its one-sidedness ... flirts with propaganda.

The script? Please.
The most horrific movie experience I've had since ``Can't Stop The Music.'' It may as well be called ``Jar-Jar Binks: The Movie.'' It's that painful.

(Gulpilil) is a commanding screen presence, and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass.
An enchanting spectacular for Potter fans anxious to ride the Hogwarts Express toward a new year of magic and mischief.

It may not be history â but then again, what if it is? â but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies I've had in a while.

The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than, as was more likely, a victim of mental illness.

Nothing happens, and it happens to flat characters.

Extremely bad.

Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing.
A special kind of movie, this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of Memento...

Symbolically, Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a celebration of feminine energy, a tribute to the power of women to heal.
Hollywood's answer to an air ball.
It's obviously struck a responsive chord with many South Koreans, and should work its magic in other parts of the world.

A miraculous movie, I'm Going Home is so slight, yet overflows with wisdom and emotion.

Passionate, irrational, long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula, Helga figures prominently in this movie, and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats.
The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly... Alas, Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman (who never gets to play that flute) has all the charm of a meltdown.

An engrossing story that combines psychological drama, sociological reflection, and high-octane thriller.
A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration.
The movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite, but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness.

It has charm to spare, and unlike many romantic comedies, it does not alienate either gender in the audience.

One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison.
As a singular character study, it's perfect. It's also the year's sweetest movie.

Tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm, but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality.

A mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic Jackie Chan to even younger audiences.
This is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the Saturday matinee, and it still is.

A film that presents an interesting, even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations.
Atom Egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues

Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection, several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme.
Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy, there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors.

Fairly run-of-the-mill.
There's back-stabbing, inter-racial desire and, most importantly, singing and dancing.

Poignant and delicately complex.

Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment: it's more like entertainment for trolls.

The ingenuity that Parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of Wilde himself.
(Garbus) discards the potential for pathological study, exhuming instead, the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation.
Diaz, Applegate, Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert, if not amused.
The film's center will not hold.
It's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man clichÃ© atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of (Woo's) best work.
Clever but not especially compelling.
Douglas McGrath's Nicholas Nickleby does Dickens as it should be done cinematically.
It has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion. It risks seeming slow and pretentious, because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise.

A moving picture that does not move.
Watching Beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it.

Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb.

Once again, director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours.
It's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go, and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination.
Earnest but heavy-handed.

Dreary tale of middle-class angst
It never rises to its clever what-if concept.
Be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat, tense with suspense. The Ring never lets you off the hook.

Ultimately, it ponders the reasons we need stories so much.

This is mostly well-constructed fluff, which is all it seems intended to be.
Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative, but he does display an original talent.

A clichÃ©d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men.
One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced.
It's drab. It's uninteresting. It squanders Chan's uniqueness; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt!

Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid, but when it has the temerity to run over two hours, you feel like winding up with a kick.

This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own.

Harrison's Flowers puts its heart in the right place, but its brains are in no particular place at all.

Nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions, one part romance novel, one part recipe book.

For something as splendid-looking as this particular film, the viewer expects something special but instead gets (sci-fi) rehash.
Would Benigni's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster?
A piece of mildly entertaining, inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category: unembarrassing but unmemorable.
Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary.
That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions, defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks.

The whole talking-animal thing is grisly.
Fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense.
This pathetic junk is barely an hour long. Nevertheless, it still seems endless.
Nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure.
McTiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious.

Many of Benjamins' elements feel like they've been patched in from an episode of Miami Vice.
Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would.

This is Sandler running on empty, repeating what he's already done way too often.
I'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year.
Soderbergh, like Kubrick before him, may not touch the planet's skin, but understands the workings of its spirit.
...hokey art house pretension.
Most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments; ``Frailty'' leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home.

Sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative.

Say this for the soundtrack, it drowns out the lousy dialogue.
Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core.
I'd be lying if I said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of Kung Pow.

There's...an underlying Old World sexism to Monday Morning that undercuts its charm.
The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture, the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative (and sometimes illegal) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults.
Exactly what its title implies: lusty, boisterous and utterly charming.
A conventional, but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in Ireland over a man's right to raise his own children.

(Reaches) wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair.
Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects. He just wants them to be part of the action, the wallpaper of his chosen reality. Here, thankfully, they are.

It's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie, directed by Scott Kalvert, about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches, gratuitous violence, or empty machismo.
Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece, the movie possesses its own languorous charm.
Every dance becomes about seduction, where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated, and sex is currency.

As refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream.
Maudlin and melodramatic we expected. Boring we didn't.
Between bursts of automatic gunfire, the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism.
Despite bearing the Paramount imprint, it's a bargain-basement European pickup. What's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up. Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there

A bizarre piece of work, with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy, rape and suspected murder

Ken Russell would love this. In one scene, we get a stab at soccer hooliganism, a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes.
The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures.
Lacking substance and soul, Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney's cutoffs.
The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap. Any rock pile will do for a set. Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap.

Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes. Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race, you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it.
'De Niro...is a veritable source of sincere passion that this Hollywood contrivance orbits around.'
Predictable and cloying, though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle.

I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where I wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail.
Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided, here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation.
A fun ride.

A visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects.
The film is all over the place, really. It dabbles all around, never gaining much momentum.
What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears' first movie.
Duvall is strong as always.
Whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy, a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us. If horses could fly, this is surely what they'd look like.
Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic, but forgive me if I've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school ``cartoon''.
This is a stunning film, a one-of-a-kind tour de force.
Whenever you think you've figured out Late Marriage, it throws you for a loop.
Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises.
Lisa Rinzler's cinematography may be lovely, but Love Liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout, maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension.
It's traditional moviemaking all the way, but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit.

Sheridan is painfully bad, a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb.
comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special, freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class. ...Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears, ``Crossroads'' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns.
A soggy, cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title.
Nothing about it fits.
Whereas last year's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie, this equally brutal outing merely sustains it.
A refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale.

You don't need to know your Ice-T's from your Cool-J's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned, something is rotten in the state of California.

Schaefer's...determination to inject farcical raunch...drowns out the promise of the romantic angle.
As directed by Dani Kouyate of Burkina Faso, Sia lacks visual flair. But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast, and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie, no matter who runs them.

Missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating, riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane.

The first Bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun.

The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles, whether they be of nature, of man or of one another.
Believability wasn't one of the film's virtues.

Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues.
Exciting and well-paced.

Mr. Caine and Mr. Fraser are the whole show here, with their memorable and resourceful performances.
Denis O'Neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche, a last-second goal to win the championship, but it neglects few others.
The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and, instead, rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep. I like Frank the Pug, though.
Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending. Now he makes them.
A beautifully observed character piece.
The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy, but there's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can, given the embarrassing script and weak direction.

A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine.
Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy, treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented.
One of the year's best films, featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Julianne Moore.
Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment. Still, it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered.
Grating and tedious.
The film is exhilarating to watch because Sandler, liberated from the constraints of formula, reveals unexpected depths as an actor.
It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling. ``Interview'' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into.

It's secondary to American Psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours.
While surprisingly sincere, this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing.
This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now.

Twenty years after its first release, E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg's misunderstood career.

Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad.
When the plot kicks in, the film loses credibility.

The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams, even though her performance is more interesting (and funnier) than his.

Impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises.
Polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own World War II experience in his signature style.
Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams, for which he should not be forgiven. Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote, directed, starred and produced -- is beyond me.
The huskies are beautiful, the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent.
The plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story. But while the highly predictable narrative falls short, Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold.

There's plenty to impress about E.T.
The acting alone is worth the price of admission.

It's amazingly perceptive in its subtle, supportive but unsentimental look at the Marks family.
As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is, it could be a lot better if it were, well, more adventurous.
While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor, the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier.
Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance.
Both the crime story and the love story are unusual. But they don't fit well together and neither is well told.
...if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie, you might want to catch Freaks as a matinee.
Schmaltzy and unfunny, Adam Sandler's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad, Little Nicky bad, 10 Worst List bad.
(A) slummer.
This story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments.
A lack of thesis makes Maryam, in the end, play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special.
Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort.
Cho's timing is priceless.
More whiny downer than corruscating commentary.
As an introduction to the man's theories and influence, Derrida is all but useless; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man, however, it's invaluable.
Hardman is a grating, mannered onscreen presence, which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast.
Although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick, ``Orange County'' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be.

This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate, surgical touch. But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick (remember Cabin Boy?) just pound away.
The kind of primal storytelling that George Lucas can only dream of.

U.S. audiences may find (Attal and Gainsbourg's) unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what Hollywood typically concocts.

It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times, but is just too lame to work or be cool at others.
Like the best 60 Minutes exposÃ©, the film (at 80 minutes) is actually quite entertaining.

A winning and wildly fascinating work.
A well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity.
As it stands, Crocodile Hunter has the hurried, badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla, which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction.
For those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s, the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed.

William Shatner, as a pompous professor, is the sole bright spot...
The humor isn't as sharp, the effects not as innovative, nor the story as imaginative as in the original. But it could have been worse.

Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized, quasi-Shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil.
While some of the camera work is interesting, the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work.

Polished Korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as Hollywood action epics. Is this progress?
It has a caffeinated, sloppy brilliance, sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care, but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame.

This engrossing, characteristically complex Tom Clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time.

Whether or not you buy Mr. Broomfield's findings, the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight, pale Mr. Broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover.
Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno.
... a good, if not entirely fresh, look at war.

The bottom line, at least in my opinion, is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film.
Everything's serious, poetic, earnest and -- sadly -- dull.
Many a parent and their teen (or preteen) kid could bond while watching A Walk To Remember. So could young romantics out on a date.

Life on the rez is no picnic: this picture shows you why.
There are a few chuckles, but not a single gag sequence that really scores, and the stars seem to be in two different movies.

The script covers huge, heavy topics in a bland, surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why, for instance, good things happen to bad people.
Much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization, Haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation.

Muddled, trashy and incompetent
Oscar Wilde's masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest, may be the best play of the 19th century. It's so good that its relentless, polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions, but even Oliver Parker's movie adaptation.
Coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that, despite a fairly slow paced, almost humdrum approach to character development, still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema.

Viveka Seldahl and Sven Wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget.
(A) satisfying niblet.

...a movie that, quite simply, shouldn't have been made.

We get the comedy we settle for.

Judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women, Foolish Choices for advice.
Confessions may not be a straightforward bio, nor does it offer much in the way of Barris' motivations, but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture.
The plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours.
High Crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience.
Maguire is a surprisingly effective Peter/Spider-Man.
Some elements of it really blow the big one, but other parts are decent.
``Antwone Fisher'' is an earnest, by-the-numbers effort by Washington. It won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking.

Even by dumb action-movie standards, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie.
Unlike Trey Parker, Sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny, not actually exploiting it yourself.
If there's nothing fresh about Wannabes, which was written by Mr. DeMeo, who produced and directed the film with Charles A. Addessi, much of the time the movie feels authentic.
Brosnan is more feral in this film than I've seen him before and Halle Berry does her best to keep up with him.
Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me (horrors!) into Scrooge.
The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher, and reflects the worst of their shallow styles: wildly overproduced, inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one (and no one).

Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama.
Anyone who ever fantasized about space travel but can't afford the $20 million ticket to ride a Russian rocket should catch this IMAX offering.
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish, and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours.
It's fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark.
As the movie dragged on, I thought I heard a mysterious voice, and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign. I have returned from the beyond to warn you: this movie is 90 minutes long, and life is too short.
A creepy, intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man...about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy.

I'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute.
The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life. But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored.
Shadyac, who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams, trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies.
Zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight.

The story ... is moldy and obvious.
The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon.

Meandering and glacially paced, and often just plain dull.
I'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled, but, for those with at least a minimal appreciation of Woolf and Clarissa Dalloway, The Hours represents two of those well spent.

Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time.
I can't recommend it. But it's surprisingly harmless.
In addition to Hoffman's powerful acting clinic, this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt, or will feel someday.
Its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes, which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway.
It's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue, only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary, pasty lumpen.

Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment.
Tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with Kieslowski's lyrical pessimism; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski's work aspired to, including the condition of art.

An important movie, a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values.
Heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart.

Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter.
It isn't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie--if only it were that grand a failure! It's just that it's so not-at-all-good. And I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch.

A party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid.
It remains to be seen whether Statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre, but then again, who says he has to?
What saves it ... and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks, is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense, such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist Alice.
A perfect example of rancid, well-intentioned, but shamelessly manipulative movie making.
Anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in 'The Ring.'
Most consumers of lo mein and General Tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it, so, hopefully, this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons.

Like Showgirls and Glitter, the most entertaining moments here are unintentional.
In the end, Ted Bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac; there's no larger point, and little social context.
This filmed Tosca -- not the first, by the way -- is a pretty good job, if it's filmed Tosca that you want. I'll stay with the stage versions, however, which bite cleaner, and deeper.
The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill.
Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured.
Enjoy it for what it is; you can hate yourself later.

The movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it.

Infidelity drama is nicely shot, well-edited and features a standout performance by Diane Lane.
Sometimes there are very, very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely.
The film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone.
Like Mike is a harmlessly naÃ¯ve slice of b-ball fantasy, fit for filling in during the real NBA's off-season.

Showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation.
I am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here.
Some of it is clever, but it is never melodic/
Old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment.
Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs, its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before.
Like the original, this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen's astringent wit.
Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness, although, it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange. The fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point.
The star who helped give a spark to ``Chasing Amy'' and ``Changing Lanes'' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer's new action film, ``The Sum of All Fears.''

Like a Tarantino movie with heart, Alias Betty is richly detailed, deftly executed and utterly absorbing.
It's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances, but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable.
Disappointingly, the characters are too strange and dysfunctional, Tom included, to ever get under the skin, but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue, visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself.
This isn't a terrible film by any means, but it's also far from being a realized work.

A work of extraordinary journalism, but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry.
The film feels uncomfortably real, its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority.

It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly, yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling, shamelessly manipulative and contrived, and totally lacking in conviction.
We have poignancy jostling against farce, thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners, and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except, maybe, that it looks neat.
At just over an hour, Home Movie will leave you wanting more, not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face.
A teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting, less symmetrical, less obviously cross-shaped creation.
A lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world.
Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally, and log on to something more user-friendly.
The fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch Jackson, who also served as executive producer, take his smooth, shrewd, powerful act abroad.

By turns pretentious, fascinating, ludicrous, provocative and vainglorious.

I'm not sure which will take longer to heal: the welt on Johnny Knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche.
Shrewd but pointless.

In the end, the movie bogs down in insignificance, saying nothing about Kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate.
Not for the prurient or squeamish, it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture, self-loathing and sexual politics.
In addition to the overcooked, ham-fisted direction, which has all the actors reaching for the back row, the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry.
Thoughtful, even stinging at times, and lots of fun.
If you're part of her targeted audience, you'll cheer. Otherwise, maybe.
It is life affirming and heartbreaking, sweet without the decay factor, funny and sad.
If not a home run, then at least a solid base hit.

Hey, at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading.
At a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons, it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is, and knows the form's history.
It's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies, couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out, so he just slopped `em together here.
A heady, biting, be-bop ride through nighttime Manhattan, a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego.
A worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars.'
The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end, they mock the kind of folks they don't understand, ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand, either.

Love may have been in the air onscreen, but I certainly wasn't feeling any of it.

In execution, this clever idea is far less funny than the original, Killers From Space.
The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine.

A wildly inconsistent emotional experience.

Did we really need a remake of ``Charade?''
Its gentle, touching story creeps into your heart.
Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern.
A stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity, but to help us clearly see the world of our making.
This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker, but good actors, good poetry and good music help sustain it.
American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an Indian-American would recognize. And the lesson, in the end, is nothing new.
Cusack's just brilliant in this.
(Hayek) throws herself into this dream Hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto, she strikes a potent chemistry with Molina and she gradually makes us believe she is Kahlo.
An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing, but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message.
The real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star, Jean Reno, who resembles Sly Stallone in a hot sake half-sleep.
Most of the action setups are incoherent.
Compellingly watchable.
You'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and, perhaps, give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it.
Haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration.
``One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid?'' Um.....isn't that the basis for the entire plot?
An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously.
What could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever, charming tale â as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters.
Tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down.

On the surface a silly comedy, Scotland, PA would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play.
Jason X has cheesy effects and a hoary plot, but its macabre, self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot.
Walter Hill's Undisputed is like a 1940s Warner Bros. B picture, and I mean that as a compliment.
This is as respectful a film as Byatt fans could hope for, though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary.
This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are, and how to push them.
Greengrass (working from Don Mullan's script) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in Northern Ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation.
Best described as I Know What You Did Last Winter.
One of those staggeringly well-produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next, hastily, emptily.
There's just no currency in deriding James Bond for being a clichÃ©d, doddering, misogynistic boy's club.
Collateral Damage is, despite its alleged provocation post-9/11, an antique, in the end. As are its star, its attitude and its obliviousness.
(Two) fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada, and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now.
Has its share of arresting images.
Daughter From Danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds. It doesn't flinch from its unsettling prognosis, namely, that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain.
What the audience feels is exhaustion, from watching a movie that is dark (dark green, to be exact), sour, bloody and mean.
A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year.
Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy.
You'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot. You'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus.
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene. What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test.
Flat, misguided comedy.
The whole is quite entertaining, but despite its virtues, there is an unsettled feeling to the film.
George Clooney proves he's quite a talented director and Sam Rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.
Consummate actor Barry has done excellent work here.
Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew, and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic.
This is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary!
Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood may not be exactly divine, but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya, what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances.
Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another.
The overall fabric is hypnotic, and Mr. Mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy.
A journey through memory, a celebration of living, and a sobering rumination on fatality, classism, and ignorance.

A provocative movie about loss, anger, greed, jealousy, sickness and love.
A lean, deftly shot, well-acted, weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s European-set spy pictures.
Fast-paced and wonderfully edited, the film is extremely thorough.
A crisp psychological drama (and) a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old ``Twilight Zone'' episode.
The stripped-down dramatic constructs, austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics, obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt.
The ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance, and the writing is tight and truthful, full of funny situations and honest observations.
Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama.
As much as I laughed throughout the movie, I cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment, or even performance art, although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain.
What it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and B-grade stylishness.
With Notorious C.H.O. Cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with Pryor, Carlin and Murphy.
You have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings.
Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game, this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness.
An uncomfortable movie, suffocating and sometimes almost senseless, The Grey Zone does have a center, though a morbid one.
If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational, the movie stirs us as well.
An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic.
Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility.
Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected (even, at times, preposterous) turns, Love is just too, too precious in the end.
This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and, because of its heightened, well-shaped dramas, twice as powerful.
It's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow.
Collateral Damage is trash, but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't.
Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form, but far too clunky, didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie.
If Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure, it comes to life in the performances.
It's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and, not far down the line, to find a place among the studio's animated classics.
McConaughey's fun to watch, the dragons are okay, not much fire in the script.
The direction, by George Hickenlooper, has no snap to it, no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism.
Like a precious and finely cut diamond, magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock.
A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander, some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story.
... a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of Legally Blonde and Drop Dead Gorgeous, starring Piper Perabo in what could be her breakthrough role.
Staggeringly dreadful romance.
Combines sharp comedy, old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics, and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead ***, but also about dealing with regret and, ultimately, finding redemption.
Children may not understand everything that happens -- I'm not sure even Miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated, and undoubtedly delighted.
A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be.
Sillier, cuter, and shorter than the first (as best I remember), but still a very good time at the cinema.
Humorous, artsy, and even cute, in an off-kilter, dark, vaguely disturbing way.
Kinnear gives a tremendous performance.
A good music documentary, probably one of the best since The Last Waltz.
Like a can of 2-day old Coke. You can taste it, but there's no fizz.

If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con.
It's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original.
Good for a few unintentional laughs, ``Extreme Ops'' was obviously made for the ``XXX'' crowd, people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting, writing, and direction.
The result, however well-intentioned, is ironically just the sort of disposable, kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's Hollywood.
So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie.
(Taymor) utilizes the idea of making Kahlo's art a living, breathing part of the movie, often catapulting the artist into her own work. This isn't a new idea. It's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion.
Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality, it fails the most basic relevancy test as well.
This is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years.
(Serry) wants to blend politics and drama, an admirable ambition. It's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one.
No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina.
One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that doesn't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect.
Fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict, inextricably entwined through family history, each seeing himself in the other, neither liking what he sees.
Ultimately, in the history of the Academy, people may be wondering what all that jazz was about ``Chicago'' in 2002. Zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
In its dry and forceful way, it delivers the same message as Jiri Menzel's Closely Watched Trains and Danis Tanovic's No Man's Land.
This is DiCaprio's best performance in anything ever, and easily the most watchable film of the year.
A charming but slight comedy.
If it's seldom boring, well, it's also rarely coherent.
This rather unfocused, all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens... or if it were subtler... or if it had a sense of humor.
You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject.

It's a loathsome movie, it really is and it makes absolutely no sense.
Rollerball IS as bad as you think, and worse than you can imagine.

There is a welcome lack of pretension about the film, which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure.

Schepisi, aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch British actor who did not appear in Gosford Park (as well as one, Ms. Mirren, who did), has succeeded beyond all expectation.
The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time, and Clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix.

Gloriously straight from the vagina.
An utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question.
The band's courage in the face of official repression is inspiring, especially for aging hippies (this one included).
In both the writing and cutting, it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you. You end up simply admiring this bit or that, this performance or that.
Easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year.
Lan Yu is a genuine love story, full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery.
What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares?
An interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse, three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama.
Despite a quieter middle section, involving Aragorn's dreams of Arwen, this is even better than The Fellowship. There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away.

Dogtown is hollow, self-indulgent, and - worst of all - boring.
Despite a performance of sustained intelligence from Stanford and another of subtle humour from Bebe Neuwirth, as an older woman who seduces Oscar, the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich New York intelligentsia - and its off
Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character, we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back.
Suffers from all the excesses of the genre.

An unforgettable look at morality, family, and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage.

The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough. Do we really need the Tiger Beat version?
Makes S&M seem very romantic, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight.
I'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind, crippled, Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking.
It may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while, but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
The picture, scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination, is a monument to bad in all its florid variety.
A collage of clichÃ©s and a dim echo of allusions to other films.
A thoroughly enjoyable, heartfelt coming-of-age comedy.
Director Oliver Parker labors so hard to whip life into The Importance of Being Earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two.
The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America.
At times, the suspense is palpable, but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential.
A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going.
A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit.
A supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama. It ends up being neither, and fails at both endeavors.
One of the best films I have ever seen, constantly pulling the rug from underneath us, seeing things from new sides, plunging deeper, getting more intense.

An irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale.
There's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale.

National Lampoon's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion

Both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics.

This is a finely written, superbly acted offbeat thriller.
Cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes, as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of Denmark's Dogma movement.
Ultimately, Sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic, and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness.
Funny in a sick, twisted sort of way.
Much of this slick and sprightly CGI feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings.
You really have to salute writer-director Haneke (he adapted Elfriede Jelinek's novel) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful, brutally shocking and difficult to watch.
A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material.
Though Nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed, the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature.

Provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of Todd Solondz.
Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending.
Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director, but how long will filmmakers copy the ``Saving Private Ryan'' battle scenes before realizing Steven Spielberg got it right the first time?
Enough may pander to our basest desires for payback, but unlike many revenge fantasies, it ultimately delivers.
The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story, character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together.
The movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true. This is the stuff that Disney movies are made of.
It is risky, intelligent, romantic and rapturous from start to finish.
Although What Time offers Tsai's usual style and themes, it has a more colorful, more playful tone than his other films.
This is art paying homage to art.
Sparse but oddly compelling.
There's no denying that Burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him.
Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film.
The film truly does rescue (the Funk Brothers) from Motown's shadows. It's about time.
Analyze That regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes, with a few new swings thrown in.

I didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube, and his skinny buddy Mike Epps, to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood.
It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them.

The film is small in scope, yet perfectly formed.
Deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant.

The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor.
The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence.
A minor film with major pleasures from Portuguese master Manoel de Oliviera...
Sex ironically has little to do with the story, which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never, ever, leave a large dog alone with a toddler. But never mind all that; the boobs are fantasti
It may be a no-brainer, but at least it's a funny no-brainer.
However stale the material, Lawrence's delivery remains perfect; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out, pandering palaver is actually funny.
For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over, No Such Thing is a big letdown.
It celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity, glancing vividly back at what Hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light.'

Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies...or any other John Woo flick for that matter.
When (De Palma's) bad, he's really bad, and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done.
Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny.
The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent, meandering, and sometimes dry plot.
One fantastic (and educational) documentary.
The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality, but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious.
After one gets the feeling that the typical Hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here, it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of Zishe and the fiery presence of Hanussen.
Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres, existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers/Abrahams films, and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries, The Farrelly Brothers.
This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson's E! True Hollywood Story.

The author's devotees will probably find it fascinating; others may find it baffling.
The very definition of what critics have come to term an ``ambitious failure.''
You see Robert De Niro singing - and dancing to - West Side Story show tunes. Choose your reaction: A.) That sure is funny! B.) That sure is pathetic!
For a film about explosions and death and spies, ``Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever'' seems as safe as a children's film. Well, in some of those, the mother deer even dies.
A very funny movie.
Faultlessly professional but finally slight.
The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance, which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile, and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react.

It's up to you to decide whether to admire these people's dedication to their cause or be repelled by their dogmatism, manipulativeness and narrow, fearful view of American life.

A delightful, if minor, pastry of a movie.

This is a children's film in the truest sense. It's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message, so it's great for the kids. Parents, on the other hand, will be ahead of the plot at all times, and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil

(Majidi) makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day.
The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical. What's worse is that Pelosi knows it.
These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers.
Full of surprises.
The problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot. Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent, we all could have stopped watching long ago.
The idea is more interesting than the screenplay, which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy, unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run.
Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story.
The performances are an absolute joy.

Ice Cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas, but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin.
An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work, every bit as imperious as Katzenberg's The Prince of Egypt from 1998.
Compelling revenge thriller, though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady.
All but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure.
An emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes, with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do.
This is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology, either liberal or conservative. Mr. Scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated.

It's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring.
It seems like I have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now I can't wait for the sequel.

The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary.
A reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz, Spielberg knows how to tell us about people.
Often hilarious, well-shot and, importantly, entertaining, Hell House is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed.
... Jones, despite a definitely distinctive screen presence, just isn't able to muster for a movie that, its title notwithstanding, should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts.
It is amusing, and that's all it needs to be.
Mostly, (Goldbacher) just lets her complicated characters be unruly, confusing and, through it all, human.

The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day.
Trivial where it should be profound, and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere.
The camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format, before swooping down on a string of exotic locales, scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm.
By no means a great movie, but it is a refreshingly forthright one.
After an uncertain start, Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with Bullock's memorable first interrogation of Gosling.
Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision, but that vision is beginning to feel, if not morally bankrupt, at least terribly monotonous.

Director Nancy Savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could.
A terrific date movie, whatever your orientation.

The film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers.
If Welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way.
A long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been.
The cast is top-notch and I predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over Michael Idemoto as Michael.
The director, Mark Pellington, does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister, menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights, a rattling noise, and a bump on the head.
Irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs. There are far worse messages to teach a young audience, which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy.
It made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters. I thought the relationships were wonderful, the comedy was funny, and the love 'real'.
It believes it's revealing some great human truths, when, in reality, it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile.
A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style, down-and-dirty laugher for the female set.
Imagine (if possible) a Pasolini film without passion or politics, or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor, and you have some idea of the glum, numb experience of watching O Fantasma.

Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films: Young is cool, and too young is too cool.
Sly, sophisticated and surprising.
Greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past, and he is matched by Schweig, who carries the film on his broad, handsome shoulders.
A live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze.
...stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier.
The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn, and the nicest thing I can say is that I can't remember a single name responsible for it.

Inventive, fun, intoxicatingly sexy, violent, self-indulgent and maddening.
The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops, but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours.
The Ya-Ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better. Translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be Ya-Ya.

Barry convinces us he's a dangerous, secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful.
``Brown Sugar'' admirably aspires to be more than another ``Best Man'' clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film.
Lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that Brown played in American culture as an athlete, a movie star, and an image of black indomitability.
It's enough to watch Huppert scheming, with her small, intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain, and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that Chabrol spins.
A timely look back at civil disobedience, anti-war movements and the power of strong voices.
What's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm.
Thurman and Lewis are hilarious throughout.
Overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances.
Frida isn't that much different from many a Hollywood romance. What sets it apart is the vision that Taymor, the avant garde director of Broadway's The Lion King and the film Titus, brings.

A seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by Georgian-Israeli director Dover Kosashvili.
Even if Invincible is not quite the career peak that The Pianist is for Roman Polanski, it demonstrates that Werner Herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse, marvelously twisted shapes history has taken.
What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material.

It's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut, Mad Cows.
Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles... so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential.

The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things: unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs.

A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of (Besson's) earlier work.

A true-blue delight.
Only in its final surprising shots does Rabbit-Proof Fence find the authority it's looking for.

A little too pat for its own good.

The plot twists give I Am Trying to Break Your Heart an attraction it desperately needed.

If you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle, Quitting hits home with disorienting force.
Moonlight Mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things. It is sentimental but feels free to offend, is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters, is about grief and yet permits laughter.
Beautifully produced.
The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs.
The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy.

No number of fantastic sets, extras, costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story.

Although tender and touching, the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing.
The movie itself is far from disappointing, offering an original take on courtroom movies, a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star Bruce Willis.

As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer, the rest of us will be lulled into a coma.
It's hard to say who might enjoy this, are there Tolstoy groupies out there? It's dark and tragic, and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death

This bracingly truthful antidote to Hollywood teenage movies that slather Clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty.
A colorful, vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse, lushly photographed and beautifully recorded.
A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie.
The inspirational screenplay by Mike Rich covers a lot of ground, perhaps too much, but ties things together, neatly, by the end.

Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers, the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price.
The film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design.

The plot grows thin soon, and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution.

More busy than exciting, more frantic than involving, more chaotic than entertaining.
The dialogue is cumbersome, the simpering soundtrack and editing more so.

The film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need, history and presumption tangle, and sometimes destroy, blood ties.
The film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place.

It jumps around with little logic or continuity, presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular, anciently demanding mÃ©tier.
(Clooney's) debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined, but it has a tremendous, offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him, especially the Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh.
It delivers some chills and sustained unease, but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning.
Imagine Kevin Smith, the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey, if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor. The result might look like Vulgar.

Scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism.
The film is ... determined to treat its characters, weak and strong, as fallible human beings, not caricatures, and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation.

A terrifically entertaining specimen of Spielbergian sci-fi.

One thing is for sure: This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou.
The entire cast is first-rate, especially Sorvino.
The furious coherence that (DeNiro) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself, which feels, as it plods toward the end, less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing.

From the dull, surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait.
A sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration.

This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's Tootsie, forgetting only to retain a single laugh.
Austin Powers in Goldmember is a cinematic car wreck, a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride.
A funny, triumphant, and moving documentary.

The best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like, but how the creative process itself operates.

But this is not a movie about an inhuman monster; it's about a very human one.
This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary. Hmmm...might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener?
