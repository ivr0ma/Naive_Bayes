In the book-on-tape market, the film of ``The Kid Stays in the Picture'' would be an abridged edition

The film contains no good jokes, no good scenes, barely a moment when Carvey's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment.
You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway, where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical, oddly abstract, and excruciatingly literal.
... has virtually no script at all ...

You come away wishing, though, that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story.
Most impressive, though, is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds.
At times THE GUYS taps into some powerful emotions, but this kind of material is more effective on stage. It's not a motion picture; it's an utterly static picture.
Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable.
Life is a crock -- or something like it.
The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath...

None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest.
Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation. How about surprising us by trying something new?
Miller is playing so free with emotions, and the fact that children are hostages to fortune, that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness.

``Catch Me'' feels capable of charming the masses with star power, a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a Spielberg trademark.
A Meatballs for the bare-midriff generation.
Is this love or is it masochism? Binoche makes it interesting trying to find out.
You could love Safe Conduct (Laissez Passer) for being a subtitled French movie that is 170 minutes long. You could hate it for the same reason.

Bravo for history rewritten, and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love.
Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often.

A dull, dumb and derivative horror film.
It provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds.

Sorority Boys, which is as bad at it is cruel, takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it.

A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments (including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether).

A much better documentary -- more revealing, more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian English title would have you believe.

(A) rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity.

The movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life.
Even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many, although in reality they are not enough. Every child's story is what matters. This film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost.

For all its surface frenzy, High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view, so little to offer.

Ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent Chinese immigrant's experiences in New York City.
When compared to the usual, more somber festival entries, Davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart, smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic.

The smash 'em-up, crash 'em-up, shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense.
Cherry Orchard is badly edited, often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story.'
A compelling French psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart.
What makes the movie work -- to an admittedly limited extent -- is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers. Weaver and LaPaglia are both excellent, in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk.
It's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that, have at it.

What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama.
Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of God in the fifth Trek flick.
A thunderous ride at first, quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action. Still, this flick is fun, and host to some truly excellent sequences.
One of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears.

An unflinching look at the world's dispossessed.

A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis.

About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life.
Crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance, music, suspense and action.

This is cool, slick stuff, ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters.
Most haunting about ``Fence'' is its conclusion, when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize, much to our dismay, that this really did happen. Noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping, dramatic, Hollywood moments to keep us
The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than, say, ten... make that three minutes.
Nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion, rather than the overuse of special effects.

A modestly comic, modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that, in terms of authenticity, is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight.

At the one-hour mark, Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion.
Rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre, who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects.
...fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense.
Press the delete key.

Catch it... if you can!
I'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy,' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming.
There's real visual charge to the filmmaking, and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence.

A sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale.
An awkward hybrid of genres that just doesn't work.
Bland but harmless.

(A) boldly stroked, luridly coloured, uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain.
A fascinating and fun film.
It is a strength of a documentary to disregard available bias, especially as temptingly easy as it would have been with this premise.
It's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly.
Like its title character, this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and, also like its hero, it remains brightly optimistic, coming through in the end.

Resourceful and ingenious entertainment.
The parts are better than the whole (bizarre, funny, tragic - like love in New York).
Graphic sex may be what's attracting audiences to Unfaithful, but gripping performances by Lane and Gere are what will keep them awake.
An invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to Massoud, whose charm, cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent.
Like Leon, it's frustrating and still oddly likable.
What Madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately, it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing, sometimes all at once.

(Dong) makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view, and he does such a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets you riled up.
``The best Disney movie since the Lion King''
...a roller-coaster ride of a movie
Despite engaging offbeat touches, Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast.
...a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone.
Like its bizarre heroine, it irrigates our souls.
The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
Each punch seen through prison bars, the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs. man as Brother-Man vs. The Man.
It's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic. Unfortunately, that's precisely what Arthur Dong's Family Fundamentals does.

Witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image, but it's Dench who really steals the show.
Bogdanovich taps deep into the Hearst mystique, entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal.

Nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose, poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy.
An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch.
A big fat pain.
Star/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own.

Go for La Salle's performance, and make do as best you can with a stuttering script.

Ya-Yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film.
Frenetic but not really funny.

It is a challenging film, if not always a narratively cohesive one.
...unlike (Scorsese's Mean Streets), Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot.
Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances...keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease.
Not so much farcical as sour.
Both flawed and delayed, Martin Scorcese's Gangs of New York still emerges as his most vital work since GoodFellas.
Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully, this remains a film about something, one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern.
Fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven; others need not necessarily apply.
The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste.
The last scenes of the film are anguished, bitter and truthful. Mr. Koshashvili is a director to watch.

A strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama.
The Salton Sea has moments of inspired humour, though every scrap is of the darkest variety.
A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion.
The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters.
What a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is.
An instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick.
Charming and funny (but ultimately silly) movie.
Originality is sorely lacking.
No, I don't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star, nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money.
both overstuffed and undernourished... The film can't be called a solid success, although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate Clooney might have better luck next time.
Woo's fights have a distinct flair. His warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos.
The movie worked for me right up to the final scene, and then it caved in.
Comes across as a relic from a bygone era, and its convolutions...feel silly rather than plausible.
Manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting.
A bodice-ripper for intellectuals.
The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip. The end result is a film that's neither.
If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star, wait until you've seen him eight stories tall.
Two Weeks Notice has appeal beyond being a Sandra Bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy.
Burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off.
Slight but enjoyable documentary.
It works well enough, since the thrills pop up frequently, and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory.
This is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable.
Could I have been more geeked when I heard that Apollo 13 was going to be released in IMAX format? In a word: No.
Barely gets off the ground.
With its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel, Bloody Sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in Derry.
It's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up, a terrific climax, and some nice chills along the way.
The additional storyline is interesting and entertaining, but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story. I like the new footage and still love the old stuff.
'Possession,' based on the book by A.S. Byatt, demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
Provides a porthole into that noble, trembling incoherence that defines us all.
Costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac's perfunctory directing chops, and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier.
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen George Roy Hill's 1973 film, ``The Sting.''
Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough, but she needs to shake up the mix, and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine.
The thriller side of this movie is falling flat, as the stalker doesn't do much stalking, and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case.
Director Alfonso Cuaron gets vivid, convincing performances from a fine cast, and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace, occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of French New Wave films.
Despite the fact that this film wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, it's still not a good movie
(Soderbergh) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence, and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness.
Despite the predictable parent vs. child coming-of-age theme, first-class, natural acting and a look at ``the real Americans'' make this a charmer.
You won't like Roger, but you will quickly recognize him. And that's a big part of why we go to the movies.
Real Women Have Curves doesn't offer any easy answers.
This story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour.
Violent, vulgar and forgettably entertaining.
As they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies, Signs is a tribute to Shyamalan's gifts, which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project.
Despite its Hawaiian setting, the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick, the basic plot of ``Lilo'' could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage Shirley Temple script.
All the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi.
What is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work, The Selection, became in its final form.
The film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits, headed by Christopher Plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil Uncle Ralph I've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work.
Unfortunately, as a writer, Mr. Montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor.
Will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them.
More intimate than spectacular, E.T. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny, moving yarn that holds up well after two decades.
The criticism never rises above easy, cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters...
This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking: joyless, idiotic, annoying, heavy-handed, visually atrocious, and often downright creepy.
A feeble Tootsie knockoff.
Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
Long after you leave Justine, you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean.
The question hanging over The Time Machine is not, as the main character suggests, 'what if?' but rather, 'How can you charge money for this?'
All-in-all, the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us, but not necessarily with us.
Completely awful Iranian drama...as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque.
Vibrantly colored and beautifully designed, Metropolis is a feast for the eyes.
I know that I'll never listen to Marvin Gaye or the Supremes the same way again
It does give a taste of the Burning Man ethos, an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity.
This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes, but feels twice as long.
If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle.
Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull.
A vile, incoherent mess...a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg's brilliant 'Videodrome.'
While it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records (Sugar Hill Gang, etc.), the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences.
The crime matters less than the characters, although the filmmakers supply enough complications, close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us.
Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain. But the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure.
A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged.
A rich tale of our times, very well told with an appropriate minimum of means.
As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson, this relentless, all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all.
The people in Jessica are so recognizable and true that, as in real life, we're never sure how things will work out.
A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight, and indicative of his, if you will, out-of-kilter character, who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces.
The performances are so leaden, Michael Rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud.
Like the best of Godard's movies ... it is visually ravishing, penetrating, impenetrable.
Laughably, irredeemably awful.
Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star, but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation.
Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as (Jason Bourne).

I'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here.
I admired this work a lot.

Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business.
A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures.
Too often, Son of the Bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained ``big moment'' will occur and not ``if.''
A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy.
A uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot.

The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart.
Lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy.
Although Barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television, music and stand-up comedy, this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless `70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom.
A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne-Sophie Birot.
Is truth stranger than fiction? In (screenwriter) Charlie Kaufman's world, truth and fiction are equally strange, and his for the taking.
If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum, her tough, funny, rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time.
more precious than perspicacious
So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney won't do it one more time, as far as movies are concerned.
Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting, Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story.
The best film about baseball to hit theaters since Field of Dreams.
Directed by Kevin Bray, whose crisp framing, edgy camera work, and wholesale ineptitude with acting, tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut.

The lightest, most breezy movie Steven Spielberg has made in more than a decade. And the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him.
Recoing's fantastic performance doesn't exactly reveal what makes Vincent tick, but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat.
(Janey) forgets about her other obligations, leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes, maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies.
Perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing,' but it is. 'Drumline' shows a level of young, Black manhood that is funny, touching, smart and complicated.
Will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good, the bad and the ugly.
Its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition.
The movie has a soft, percolating magic, a deadpan suspense.
The sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in IMAX dimensions, as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins.
An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma.
Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff.
I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of Bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario, and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise.
It's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but.
Haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed.
Bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake.
Each of these stories has the potential for Touched by an Angel simplicity and sappiness, but Thirteen Conversations About One Thing, for all its generosity and optimism, never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments.
Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick, although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service.'
'...both hokey and super-cool, and definitely not in a hurry, so sit back, relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat.'
It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen.
A well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone.
A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards.

Light-years ahead of paint-by-number American blockbusters like Pearl Harbor, at least artistically.
Robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates.
(L)ame and unnecessary.

A dull, simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs, death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets.
Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot, expertly cast, paced with crisp professionalism... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report.
Take away the controversy, and it's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera.
Poignant and moving, A Walk to Remember is an inspirational love story, capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter.
Doug Liman, the director of Bourne, directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere.
Circuit queens won't learn a thing, they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets.
The film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill, though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen.
The story's pathetic and the gags are puerile.
It's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and I think that's what I liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline.
The film is a contrivance, as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence, but it's an enjoyable one.
A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer.
Though in some ways similar to Catherine Breillat's Fat Girl, Rain is the far superior film.
The Piano Teacher is not an easy film. It forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves, and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling.
Good car chases, great fight scenes, and a distinctive blend of European, American and Asian influences.
Nearly surreal, dabbling in French, this is no simple movie, and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it. I enjoyed the ride (bumps and all), creamy depth, and ultimate theme.

The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies.
A hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic French nuance.
A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply.
None of this is very original, and it isn't particularly funny.
Michael Moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining, self-aggrandizing, politically motivated documentary-making, and he's got as potent a topic as ever here.
The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value.
A breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom, while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters.
Late Marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love.
There's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue.
Everybody loves a David and Goliath story, and this one is told almost entirely from David's point of view.

The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch, so stilted and unconvincing are the performances.
DeMeo is not without talent; he just needs better material.
Director Andrew Niccol...demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame. His healthy sense of satire is light and fun....

All mood and no movie.

Weirdly, Broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end, after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car.
There was time on that second round to see the subtleties of Ramsay's portrait of grief.
A beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in Korea.
Professionally speaking, it's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller.

A cultural wildcard experience: wacky, different, unusual, even nutty.
Eerily accurate depiction of depression.
Rarely, a movie is more than a movie. Go.
A movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship Lil' Bow Wow.

A highly spirited, imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-Augustinian theology: Is God stuck in Heaven because He's afraid of His best-known creation?
Alain Choquart's camera barely stops moving, portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency, which, for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool, is both funny and irritating.
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
Directors John Musker and Ron Clements, the team behind The Little Mermaid, have produced sparkling retina candy, but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space.
`Matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout...but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy.
Madonna still can't act a lick.
One of the best rock documentaries ever. Wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many.
It feels like very light Errol Morris, focusing on eccentricity but failing, ultimately, to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs.
If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter, this is it. If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution, this is it.

Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off, with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film.
While you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out ``When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way,'' it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to ``Tonight.''
Despite Auteuil's performance, it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road, where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug.
...plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller.
What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about.

Glib, satirical documentary that fudges facts, makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism.

The performances are amiable and committed, and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye.

The movie, despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places, is wry and engrossing.
The umpteenth summer skinny dip in Jerry Bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle.
It won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke.
Piccoli's performance is amazing, yes, but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent.
Works as pretty contagious fun.
If you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like, here it is.
Occasionally funny and consistently odd, and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for Zhao.
Suffers from rambling, repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video.
A compelling yarn, but not quite a ripping one.
Take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture, and he'll be your slave for a year.
(Schweiger is) talented and terribly charismatic, qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists.
If you're in the right B-movie frame of mind, it may just scare the pants off you.

Both Garcia and Jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters, who are alternately touching and funny.

About Amy's cuteness, Amy's career success (she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself), and Amy's neuroses when it comes to men.
It turns out to be a cut above the norm, thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting.
By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk,...actually pretty good. Of course, by more objective measurements it's still quite bad.
This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic.
This slight premise ... works because of the ideal casting of the masterful British actor Ian Holm as the aged Napoleon.
For the most part Stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue.
Outside of Burger's desire to make some kind of film, it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
The gags are often a stitch.
(The digital effects) reminded me of Terry Gilliam's rudimentary old Monty Python cartoons, in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together.
The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it.
A respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details, but ultimately weak in its impact.
This charming but slight tale has warmth, wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed.
A morose little soap opera about three vapid, insensitive people who take turns hurting each other. It's a feature-length adaptation of one of those ``Can This Marriage Be Saved?'' columns from Ladies Home Journal...
Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses, but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length.
There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through.
There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time.
Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances, but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion, grief and fear.
May take its sweet time to get wherever it's going, but if you have the patience for it, you won't feel like it's wasted yours.
Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore.
They presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson, however entertainingly presented, so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes.
You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go, but it never quite gets there.
The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it. We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce, because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low.
It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film, but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy.
Oversexed, at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty, female and single.
An engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary.
Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory, Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie.
Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy, but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go.
It's another stale, kill-by-numbers flick, complete with blade-thin characters and terrible, pun-laden dialogue.
Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin, sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies.
It just goes to show, an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller.
In the end, White Oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel. It's a flashy, star-splashed reduction.
I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday, and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink.
Bluto Blutarsky, we miss you.
Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle, and more jokes land than crash, but ultimately Serving Sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd.
A breezy blend of art, history, esoteric musings and philosophy.
A tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers.
Those who love Cinema Paradiso will find the new scenes interesting, but few will find the movie improved.
Beneath Clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from Rabbit-Proof Fence.

A light, engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation.
A quietly moving look back at what it was to be Iranian-American in 1979.

This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted.
Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders, Chan wades through putrid writing, direction and timing with a smile that says, 'If I stay positive, maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures, Drunken Master.'
It's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding.

There isn't nearly enough fun here, despite the presence of some appealing ingredients.
The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles.
An empty, ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility.
The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichÃ©s from start to finish, and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience, but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
...a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy, so uneven, so damn unpleasant that I can't believe any viewer, young or old, would have a good time here.
...a sour little movie at its core; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's ...The film's ending has a ``What was it all for?'' feeling to it, but like the 1920's, the trip there is a great deal of fun.
The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters.
Has not so much been written as assembled, Frankenstein-like, out of other, marginally better shoot-em-ups.
A flawed but engrossing thriller.
While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film, it's far from being this generation's Animal House.
The gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of Chris Fuhrman's posthumously published cult novel.
The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous, the acting is robotically italicized, and truth-in-advertising hounds take note: There's very little hustling on view.
A powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love, racial tension, and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s.
Boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy, kinky fun.
I'm guessing the director is a magician. After all, he took three minutes of dialogue, 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long.
This movie got me grinning. There's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something.
The film, like Jimmy's routines, could use a few good laughs.
Holds limited appeal to those who like explosions, sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp.
Yeah, these flicks are just that damn good. Isn't it great?
(City) reminds us how realistically nuanced a Robert De Niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'Analyze This' (1999) and 'Analyze That,' promised (or threatened) for later this year.
Easier to respect than enthuse over, Andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing.
A broadly played, lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags.
Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks.

Unflinchingly bleak and desperate
The stupidest, most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter.
Too long, and larded with exposition, this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community.
It's a lovely, sad dance highlighted by Kwan's unique directing style.
I didn't find much fascination in the swinging. What they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games, of no erotic or sensuous charge. But that they are doing it is thought-provoking.
A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions.
The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times, give you a few laughs, and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks, even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end.

A pleasing, often-funny comedy.

You just know something terrible is going to happen. But when it does, you're entirely unprepared.
Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing, Hart's War, like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl, waits until after halftime to get started.
Spare yet audacious...
You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone.
A passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action.
Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date, only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments.

...with ``The Bourne Identity'' we return to the more traditional action genre.
In the end there is one word that best describes this film: honest.
